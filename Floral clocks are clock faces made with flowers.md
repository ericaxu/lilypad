# Floral clocks are clock faces made with flowers

The first floral cock was the combination of ideas from James McHattie, City Superintendent of Parks and James Ritchie, the Edinburgh clockmaker. It was planted in the West Princes Street Gardens. The design is updated each year.

In 1950, after seeing this floral clock on a business trip, Dr. Richard Hearn, then chairman of Ontario Hydro, he commissioned the worldâ€™s largest floral clock adjacent to the power plant. "ONTARIOHYDRO" were the initial 12 letters to mark the numbers.
