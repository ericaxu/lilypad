# World of Warcraft had a in-game virus that behaves like a real one

In the "Corrupted Blood" update, players will get a debuff from the regional boss. The debuff was transmitted from characters in close proximity.

The debuff was designed to disappear when the player leaves that region. But due to a game bug, the debuff never appeared. The effects even attracted attention from epidemiologists.

Interestingly, players have drastically different reactions after this happened, just like in real life: some provided aid by healing players or warning them of outbreak zones, while some intentionally contracted the debuff to spread it across the game.
