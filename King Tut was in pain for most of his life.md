# King Tut was in pain for most of his life

Tutankhamen, a.k.a. King Tut, was in pain all his life. Quite possibly related to the fact that his parents, Amenhotep III and Tiye, are brother and sister.

From advanced CT scanning and genetic testing, we know that Tut had a clubbed left foot, a curved spin, and really bad malaria. No wonder he only lived to the tender age of 19.
