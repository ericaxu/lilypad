# Words and definitions in dictionaries are not decided by an authority but rather come from analyzing existing English text

By John Holt in Learning All the Time:

>Most people don't know how dictionaries are made. Each new dictionary starts from scratch. The company making the dictionary employs thousands of "editors," to each of whom they give a list of words. The job of the editors is to collect as many examples as possible of the way in which these words are actually used. They look for the words in books, magazines, newspapers, and so forth, and every time they find one, they cut out or copy that particular example, building up a file of clippings where the words had been used. Then, reading these files, they decide from the context what the writer in each case had meant by the words. From these they make the definitions. A dictionary, in other words, is a collection of people's opinions about what words mean, as other people use them.

"A file of clippings where the words had been used" is also called the corpus of that word.
