# Hair near scalp needs to bleached last because of the heat coming from the scalp

Human body thermal energy is not particularly strong, but in the case of bleaching hair, it makes a big difference.

Because brushing all the hair will take a long time, if the roots is bleached first, the heat coming from the scalp will bleach the roots more than the ends. This results in what's called "hot roots", and it's generally not desirable.
