# Yellowstone National Park had no wolves for almost 70 years until they imported some from Canada

Before there were not wolves left, the last official killing of wolves in Yellowstone Park was when two pups found near Soda Butte Creek were killed by park rangers in 1926,

In 1995, 69 years after that, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service imported 14 wolves from Alberta, Canada. The US government paid $2,000 for each wolf. 17 more wolves were imported from Canada in 1996.
