# To thank a French Egyptologist for deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egypt gifted an obelisk to France

In 1822, Jean-François Champollion successfully deciphered ancient Egyptian. Around the same time, Champollion saw the Luxor Obelisks, a pair of ancient Egyptian obelisks that are over 3,0000 years old and each carved out of a single piece of red granite. Champollion was fascinated and urged the French government to acquire these two obelisks over the others.

In 1830, the Egypt decided to officially gift the obelisks for the contributions Champollion made. The western obelisk was moved first. It took 6 years and 2.5 million francs (about $19 million in 2020) to complete that. The second one was never moved.

Jean-François Champollion died at the early age of 41 in 1832 and never got to see the obelisk moved.
