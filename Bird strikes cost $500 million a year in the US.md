# Bird strikes cost $500 million a year in the US

> Predators can help save money. If that fact leaves you scratching your head, consider this: according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), collisions between wildlife and aircraft (mostly bird strikes) cost US civil aviation nearly $500 million a year. It takes just one bird strike to destroy a $2 million jet engine. Facts like these are just one of the reasons why John F. Kennedy Airport in New York is reintroducing top predators like eagles and peregrine falcons to control small bird populations.
