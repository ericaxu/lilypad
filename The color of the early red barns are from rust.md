# The color of the early red barns are from rust

Earliest barns weren't colored at all. Farmers soon found that they can use linseed oil as sealant to protect the wood. They also found that adding iron oxide (aka rust) would protect the barn from growth of certain fungi. Rust is easily accessible to farmers, and it's a poison to many fungi including mold and moss. The fungi themselves don't destroy the barn, but they would trap moisture in the wood, increasing its decay. The added rust makes barn a rusty red color.

Later in the 18th century, farmers start to use commercial paint on their barns. The red paint happened to be the cheapest, so the tradition continues. The tradition is still here today!
