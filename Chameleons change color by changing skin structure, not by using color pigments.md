# Chameleons change color by changing skin structure, not by using color pigments

> It is generally interpreted that these changes are due to dispersion/aggregation of pigment-containing organelles within dermal chromatophores. Here, combining microscopy, photometric videography and photonic band-gap modelling, we show that chameleons shift color through active tuning of a lattice of guanine nanocrystals within a superficial thick layer of dermal iridophores.

Dermal chromatophores is what enables cephalopods to change color and texture, and scientists used to assume chameleons do it in the same way. Turns out they don't!

- [[Pond - Chameleons]]
- [[Octopus is so good at camouflage that you won't recognize it even when up close]]
