# Michael Jackson built an entire amusement park for himself

The park is in his home, the Neverland Ranch. Jackson renamed the property to Neverland after the fantasy island in the story of Peter Pan.

There's a petting zone, three railroads, and a Ferris wheel in it, along with other things you can find in amusement parks like bummer cars and roller coaster.

By 2008, Jackson owed more than $24 million presumably to maintain the ranch. After the death of Michael Jackson, it was sold for $100 million but selling it was hard. The price kept dropping until a former family friend of Jackson purchased the property for $22 million.
