# What makes a pad?

A pad here on Lilypad is a bite-sized piece of content that consists of two parts:

1. **Pad content**. The main content of this pad. Deliver what's promised in the title in a concise and fun way.
2. **Road sign**. Tell the reader what are the next pads they can go from here.

## What makes a good pad?

### Factual

Although often interesting, theories and patterns are too abstract as entry points. Patterns can show up in the form of a list of similar pads, but not as a standalone pad.

### Interesting

A pad needs to be interesting on its own. It's something you would bring up in chat between friends, at the very least.

### Low barrier

A good pad should be approachable to laymen. It shouldn't require domain expertise to understand the gist behind the idea.
### Short

A pad is a lily pad, not an aircraft carrier! When the topic gets large, split it into more pads. The point of being small is that more connections are possible between the pads, and that our little frogs don't get lost on huge pads.

For text, although there's no hard limit, we strongly suggest staying **under 500 words**. For video, **under 15 minutes** is best. If you happen to find a long video, consider using a clip instead, or set a start timestamp so the viewer can jump to the point.
