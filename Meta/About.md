# About

Everything is connected. That's why I believe if you're interested in a few things, via connections you can get interested in and learn everything. Absolutely everything. Nothing exists in a vacuum.

All we need is a map with points of interests. And that's what Lilypad is all about. We want to you start from **interesting, tangible, and bite-sized** mini topics (they're called [[What makes a pad|pads]] here), and expand from there in small, doable steps. Just like a frog jumping between lily pads in a pond.

Lilypad is a side project started by Erica Xu in August 2023, when she is about to turn 30.

Thanks for inspiration from Quinn Dai & Gin Jiang as they work on [AFAIK](https://afaik.io/).
