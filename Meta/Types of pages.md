# Types of pages

There are two types of pages on the site:

1. Pads. See [[What makes a pad]].
2. Ponds. Wide topic area that contains lots of pads. Mainly for navigational purposes. For example, [[Pond - Fishes|Fishes]] is a Pond.
3. Patterns. Patterns are usually abstract concepts, trends, or mental models that are manifested through several pads. We put them together so if you'd like to learn more things that follow the same pattern, you can follow the backlink to the pattern page.
