# Piano has the broadest pitch range out of all instruments

With 88 keys, a standard modern piano spans 7¼ octaves from A₀ to C₈, which is 27.5 Hz to 4,186 Hz, assuming A₄ is tuned to 440 Hz.

Why not a even wider range? Because it wouldn't be useful.

> The human ear can hear sounds in the range from approximately 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but the upper limit of frequencies that the human brain can discriminate is at the very most around 4,000 Hz.

Piano's range already covers almost the entire range where humans can enjoy music.
