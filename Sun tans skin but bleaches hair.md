# Sun tans skin but bleaches hair

The sun has opposite effects on skin and hair in terms of color.

Our skin is alive, so it tries to increase melanin production to help us defend the sun rays.

On the other hand, our hair is dead. The ultraviolet rays in sunlight oxidize the hair, turning melanin into a compound that is colorless.
