# Porcelain filter was used to remove bacteria from water

The Pasteur–Chamberland filter was invented in 1884. It works because the pore size of unglazed porcelain is about 0.1 µm, where as most bacteria are bigger than that.

It was originally used to filter out bacteria from water for lab use, but as more bacteria were discovered, these filters were also in hotel and homes.
