# Chameleons don't change color to match the background

It's a popular misconception that they use color change as a camouflage.

> The chameleon's color state at any given time is controlled by a complex interaction of hormones, temperature, and the animal’s autonomic nervous system. Color change is determined by such environmental factors as light and temperature as well as by emotions—such as fright and the emotions associated with victory or defeat in battle with another chameleon.
