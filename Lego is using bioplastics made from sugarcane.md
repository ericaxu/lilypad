# Lego is using bioplastics made from sugarcane

Starting in 2018, Lego has replaced the plastics used in some of its blocks with bioplastics. These green plastics are made from the ethanol (alcohol) that's in turn made from sugarcane.

Chemically, these bioplastics are identical to polyethylene that's made from fossil fuels. They can be recycled in the same way.
