# Tsar Bomba was over 1,500 times more powerful than the two bombs dropped on Japan combined but didn't kill anyone

Little Boy was 15 kilotons, Fat Man was 21, but Soviet Union's Tsar Bomba was 50 megatons. Windows in faraway Norway and Finland were shattered by the force of the blast.

Tsar Bomba was dropped at 34,000 feet and the denotation happened at 13,000 feet. Luckily, at this height, the accompanying five-mile-wide fireball was repelled away from the surface by the force of its own shockwave and did not make contact with the earth, thus greatly reducing the amount of fallout.

Here's a previously classified footage released from Russia in 2020:
