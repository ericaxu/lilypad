# You can see the International Space Station with the naked eye

The International Space Station is the third brightest object in the sky and easy to spot if you know when to look up.

Here's how to spot it: the space station looks like an airplane or a very bright star moving across the sky, except it doesn't have flashing lights or change direction. It will also be moving considerably faster than a typical airplane (airplanes generally fly at about 600 miles (965 km) per hour; the space station flies at 17,500 miles (28,000 km) per hour).

If you want to see it, you can [sign up for an alert on NASA](https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/signup.cfm).
